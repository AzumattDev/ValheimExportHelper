# ValheimExportHelper
AssetRipper plugin to make it easy to export Valheim to a Unity project.


## Usage
1. Download ValheimExportHelper and one of the supported AssetRipper releases.
2. Extract all contents to your `AssetRipper` directory (where `AssetRipper.exe` is located).
3. Launch `ValheimExportHelper.exe` and proceed to load and extract Valheim as normal.

The following options are recommended:
- [x] **Skip StreamingAssets Folder**

Make any other changes at your own risk, the only other supported option is changing **Script Export Format** from *Decompiled* to *Dll Export Without Renaming*.
